C++ Module 07: Understanding Templates and Generic Programming
This module introduces you to template programming, which enables you to write flexible and reusable code that works with different data types.
Key Concepts Covered
Exercise 00: Function Templates
Implementation of simple function templates: swap, min, and max
Working with multiple data types through a single template interface
Understanding template type requirements and constraints
Applying function templates with different data types
Exercise 01: Iter - Template Function Implementation
Creating a function template that works with arrays of any type
Passing function pointers as template parameters
Implementing a generic iterator function that processes every element of an array
Understanding how to apply function templates to different data structures
Exercise 02: Array Class Template
Developing a generic array container using class templates
Implementing proper memory management for template classes
Creating array access operators and boundary checking
Supporting various data types in a custom container class
Managing exceptions for boundary violations
Implementation Requirements
All implementations should follow these key requirements:
Templates must be defined in header files
Full implementation of function templates and class templates
Comprehensive testing with multiple data types
Proper memory allocation and deallocation with operator new[]
Exception throwing for invalid operations
Following C++98 standard
This module provides a solid foundation in templated programming techniques, enabling you to write code that works with multiple data types while maintaining type safety and efficiency.
