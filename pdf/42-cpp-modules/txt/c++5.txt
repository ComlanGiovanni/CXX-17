C++ Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions
This module introduces exception handling in C++ through a bureaucratic simulation, teaching you how to handle error conditions gracefully.
Key Concepts Covered
Exercise 00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!

Implementation of a Bureaucrat class with constrained grade range
Custom exception classes for handling invalid grades
Exception throwing and catching mechanisms
Operator overloading for output formatting

Exercise 01: Form up, maggots!

Creating a Form class with signing requirements
Relationships between Bureaucrat and Form classes
Additional exception handling for form operations
Implementing signing functionality with proper validation

Exercise 02: No, you need form 28B, not 28C...

Converting Form to an abstract class (AForm)
Implementing concrete form types with specific behaviors
Using virtual functions and inheritance hierarchies
Executing forms with proper permission checks

Exercise 03: At least this beats coffee-making

Implementing an Intern class for form creation
Factory design pattern for object instantiation
Creating a simplified interface for form management
Avoiding excessive if/else structures with elegant design

Implementation Requirements

Exception classes do not need to follow Orthodox Canonical Form
All other classes must follow Orthodox Canonical Form
Proper hierarchical relationships between classes
Thorough error checking and appropriate exception handling
Clean message output for all operations
Following C++98 standard

This module provides practical experience with exception handling and more complex class hierarchies, teaching essential skills for robust error management in C++ applications.
