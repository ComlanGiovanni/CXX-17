C++ Module 08: Understanding Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms
This module introduces you to the Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms, enabling you to write efficient code using predefined generic data structures.
Key Concepts Covered
Exercise 00: Easy Find
Implementation of a generic function template for searching in containers
Working with STL containers to store and manipulate data
Handling exceptions for unfound elements
Using iterators to access container elements
Exercise 01: Span Class
Creating a class to store a range of integers
Implementing member functions for finding spans between elements
Managing memory allocation and limits for fixed-size containers
Supporting large data sets with at least 10,000 numbers
Using iterators to add ranges of elements efficiently
Exercise 02: Mutated Abomination
Extending the std::stack container to make it iterable
Understanding container adaptors and their limitations
Implementing iterators for non-iterable STL containers
Creating a MutantStack class that inherits from std::stack
Preserving all original functionality while adding iteration capabilities
Implementation Requirements
All implementations should follow these key requirements:
Using STL containers and algorithms appropriately
Implementing template-based solutions for enhanced flexibility
Creating proper error handling with exceptions
Following C++98 standard
Understanding iterator concepts and container behaviors
Writing comprehensive tests for all functionality
This module provides a practical introduction to the powerful features of the STL, emphasizing how to leverage existing containers and algorithms to create efficient, reusable code.
